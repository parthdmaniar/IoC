# IoC
List of IoC's captured on my honeypots. This includes source IPs, file hash, usernames, and passwords.

These will be updated daily around 0530 GMT.

# Suggested usage:

1. I *do not* recommend using the IoC's as a *block list*. Security architecture is fundamentally more meaningful as opposed firewall/network device or endpoint block lists.

2. Since the IoC list is updated daily, I would recommend using the list for your cybersecurity incident response/investigation.

3. For more information, or to report interesting/incorrect findings, give me a shoutout on @parthmaniar on twitter.
