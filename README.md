# IoC
List of IoC's captured on my honeypots. This includes source IPs, file hash, usernames, and passwords.

These will be updated daily around 0530 GMT.

# Suggested usage:

1. I *do not* recommend using the IoC's as a *block list*. Security architecture is fundamentally more meaningful as opposed firewall/network device or endpoint block lists.

2. I would recommend using the list for your incident investigation.
